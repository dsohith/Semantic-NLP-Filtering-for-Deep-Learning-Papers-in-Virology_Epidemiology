# Semantic NLP Filtering for Deep Learning Papers in Virology/Epidemiology

## Project Overview
This project implements a **semantic natural language processing (NLP) pipeline using Sentence Transformers (SBERT)** to filter and classify academic papers related to **deep learning neural networks** in the fields of **virology and epidemiology**. The goal is to improve the paper selection process beyond keyword-based searches by focusing on semantic relevance, identifying papers that specifically utilize deep learning techniques.

### Key Features:
- **Semantic Filtering**: Leverages NLP techniques to filter out irrelevant papers that do not utilize deep learning approaches.
- **Classification**: Relevant papers are classified into categories based on their method: `["text mining", "computer vision", "both", "other"]`.
- **Method Extraction**: Automatically extracts and reports the specific deep learning method used in each relevant paper.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**
- **Git**
- Python libraries specified in `requirements.txt`

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://gitlab.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
   cd your-repository-name
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Data Preparation

1. Ensure the dataset (`CSV` format) is placed in the `data/` directory. The dataset should contain **11,450 records** retrieved from PubMed through keyword-based searches.
2. Run the preprocessing script to clean the dataset and prepare it for filtering:

   ```bash
   python src/preprocessing/preprocess.py --input data/papers.csv --output data/cleaned_papers.csv
   ```

### Running the Semantic NLP Filtering

To filter and classify the papers based on their use of deep learning techniques:

```bash
python src/model/semantic_filter.py --input data/cleaned_papers.csv --output results/filtered_papers.csv
```

### Extracting Deep Learning Methods

Once relevant papers have been filtered, you can extract and classify the deep learning methods used:

```bash
python src/model/method_extraction.py --input results/filtered_papers.csv --output results/methods.csv
```

### Results

Filtered papers and their corresponding classification (e.g., `text mining`, `computer vision`) will be stored in the `results/` directory.

## Methodology

The application of **Sentence Transformers** for filtering and classification in academic research, particularly in the fields of **virology and epidemiology**, builds on earlier methods that have utilized **keyword-based** approaches for screening and classification tasks. Traditional keyword-based methods have been widely used for systematic reviews, such as in **bioinformatics** and **health science** research, where tools like **PubMed** and **Google Scholar** rely on Boolean keyword searches to retrieve relevant literature. However, research has shown that keyword-based filtering often lacks semantic depth, leading to a high inclusion of irrelevant papers (Hopewell et al., 2007). In response, newer semantic NLP techniques such as Sentence Transformers have been proposed to better capture the intent and context of scientific papers, as demonstrated by Reimers and Gurevych (2019). Sentence Transformers excel at encoding the semantic meaning of sentences or abstracts into dense vector representations, enabling them to outperform keyword-based searches by understanding the underlying context of deep learning applications in virology and epidemiology.

Research in paper classification has also advanced with the rise of machine learning and LLM-based methods. For example, classifiers such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests have been used historically to categorize scientific papers into predefined categories (e.g., methods, disease focus, etc.), but these approaches often rely on surface-level features extracted from titles and abstracts (Yu et al., 2011). More recently, large language models (LLMs) like BERT and GPT have been employed to enhance text classification tasks. LLMs are particularly adept at capturing complex, context-sensitive relationships between words, which makes them highly effective for nuanced tasks such as identifying methodological approaches in scientific papers (Devlin et al., 2018). This ability is crucial in fields like virology, where differentiating between papers using deep learning for text mining versus computer vision applications requires more than a simple keyword match.

Furthermore, studies that compare LLMs with traditional keyword-based methods show significant improvements in precision and recall for tasks like literature reviews and systematic filtering (Yu et al., 2011; Hopewell et al., 2007). The use of sentence-transformers in particular enables the identification of papers that genuinely apply deep learning techniques, as opposed to papers that merely mention these terms. For example, Sentence-BERT, as outlined by Reimers and Gurevych (2019), uses Siamese and triplet network structures to produce semantically meaningful embeddings, allowing for more accurate classification and filtering. In comparison to simple keyword-based methods, these Transformer-based models have been shown to capture complex relationships and yield more precise filtering results. This is especially beneficial when classifying papers into subfields such as text mining, computer vision, or both.

In summary, while keyword-based methods have served as a foundational approach to paper classification, their limitations in semantic understanding have been widely acknowledged. The use of Sentence Transformers and LLMs represents a significant advancement in this area, offering a more nuanced and context-aware filtering mechanism for identifying papers that employ deep learning in virology and epidemiology. This combination of machine learning with NLP models reduces the inclusion of irrelevant papers and enhances the overall accuracy of the filtering process.

### Classification and Method Extraction

The relevant papers are classified into one of four categories:
1. `Text Mining`
2. `Computer Vision`
3. `Both`
4. `Other`

For each paper, the specific **deep learning method** (e.g., CNN, RNN, LSTM, etc.) is extracted and reported.
